##### TAKEAWAYS #####

# 1. We need to remove screen plays like the first one 
#       (can do this by looking if the offensive linesman moves up, away from the QB)
# 2. Have to account for when a linebacker blitzes so time to QB is longer but only because
#       the first interaction happens later - can account for this by starting the time to QB
#       when the x values of both linesman and defender are similar (less than a yard maybe)
# 3. There are some plays where there is a double team - not common enough probably to try fixing
