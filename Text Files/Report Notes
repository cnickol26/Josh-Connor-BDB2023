The easiest way to do this will be to create an Rmarkdown and then upload that to kaggle.

- Going to first want to do an intro section
  - Here probably will talk about speed vs power, show off the R animations and film gifs
  - Maybe very limited data cleaning discussion (Plays that got filtered out like chips and scrambles)
  - Goal of our modeling is seeing who has the most potential not necessarily looking at how they performed in terms of giving up sacks, etc. 
  
  - Next go into clustering
    - Can discuss how we first did K means then decided on GMM because of the ability to look at probabilities 
    - Filtered out the ones that the model was very uncertain about
    - Can show proabilities for the 2 Myles Garrett plays from earlier
    - Show the formula for GMM
    
  - Next is our Bayesian Hierachial Model
    - Definitely will want to include the formula, talk specifically about how we are looking at the coefficients on the tackles
    - Can mention the MSEs of our 2 models
    - Maybe mention other models considered such as Random Effects, but we never really tried it so maybe not
 
  - Results section
    - 2 main figures
      - Scatterplot followed by summary table
      - Talk about best performers, reiterate how this is more about potential than actal performance
  
  - Conclusions
    - Mention here exactly how our project is beneficial
    - Can expand upon it by looking at salary and finding under valued players
      - Link to paper that did this we read earlier
