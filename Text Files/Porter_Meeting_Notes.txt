Meeting with Porter (12/20):

    Random effects model: intercept for offensive and defensive guy
    One-hot offensive players and one-hot defensive players (could also do a variable for the defensive player skill)
        Could try with defensive 
    Ridge penalty on that model is a random effects (normal prior on skill)
    Could add interaction term (probably unnecessary)
    
    Could hold out one week or one defender or a couple plays for each linesman
    
    Bayesian Hierarchical - team has its own distribution and the players have their own latent scores
        Player might be good but it's because the team they're on
    Look at intercept for each player 
    
    Simple: How many times does the defender make the QB move or touch him - binary classification
    
    We'll have two models with intercepts for each linesman
    Have linear expressions, could plug in any defensive linesman and could plug in any defensive player and get a score
        How to compare? Only against players that are going to face them or more - how would this offensive player do against everyone (plug all defenders into equation)?
    Take both of these scenarios and rank seperately (best against speed and power) or could say percent of time of each type of rush 
    
    More sophisticated: metrics for ranking: lambda mart ranks based on trees
        In survival analysis, model how long it takes for an event to occur (treatment, how long will they live). Modeling time to event is similar to time
          until defender moves back
        Could look at Cox proportional hazards model/competing risk model where we look at offensive linesman "competing" against a different offensive linesman against the same defender.
        This would be unique.
        Instead of getting numbers for each player seperately, we look at difference in time between player ability.
        This gives more of the distribution of time to event where the regression is looking more at expected time
        
    Look at residuals and see how it does over time - this could indicate that player performance changes over week - add a slope term if needed
    
    Could score a player playing against a specific team or look at salary and compare with model.
    
    Control variables: could use information from past week's performance (sacks allowed, etc.) (probably too much) - could do whether they are obvious pass plays, could also do zone or man
    
    Challenge: What happens if a QB passes right away: it will look like the defender never had time to get anywhere - could remove these plays
    
    At the end, we probably want a model that can predict in the future, not just statically on 2021. 





Connor's thoughts after talking with Porter:
    -Think your idea Josh about just looking at direction to seperate into speed and power is good
    -Could look for each time how many rows there are where the OT is within a certain distance to a DE and facing them (Binary encode and then sum with some threshold)
    -May be harder to classify speed since it's not just one or the other
        - Speed to power could be a problem
        - Could look and see if their direction at the start is straight up the field for a certain amount of yards
    -Once we have the split, Bayesian Hierarchial seems to be a good direction
        -Will be impressive to talk about in our report, which seems to be important looking at past winners
        -Priors on teams/players
            -Looking at heights and weights is proabably a good place to start
                -Has an impact on how long you can hold off a defender and most likely how fast you can get off the line
        -For power our response can be expected distance to the qb given up and compare that to actual
            -Will probably want to cut out throws under a certain amount of time
                -But can also have time to throw a variable in the model
                -Can include a variable if it is an obvious passing situation as well
        -For speed the response is harder but maybe we do expected get off time vs actual
            -Could include factors such as quarter here
                -Maybe get off time increases (slows) as the game goes on
        -Once we have both we want to aggregate in some way
            - I like the idea of using the percentages we see each rush as our weights and then ranking
            - Will want to say the way we have it set up is more of a gauge at how skilled a tackle is or their athletic ability since for speed we're not necessarily looking at if they gave up a sack, more if they were in the position or not to stop the DE
